CLI Task Tracker
A simple command-line task interpreter written in Python.
This project meets the requirements set out on the website https://roadmap.sh/projects/task-tracker.

The project uses a simple approach with classes. Each task has its own object, and all work with them is collected in a separate class. This keeps the code clear and makes it easier to add new features.

Functions
